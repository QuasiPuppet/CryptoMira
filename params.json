The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src`.\r\n\r\n**Advanced options:**\r\n\r\n* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.\r\n* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.\r\n* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.\r\n* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.\r\n\r\n### On Windows\r\nDependencies: MSVC 2012 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55.
